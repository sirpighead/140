                <h3>First Semester: Part 1</h3>
                <p> 
                    I'll start off by saying that I don't think I could ask for a better 
                    first semester of college. I had a lot of fun, enjoyed my classes(mostly),
                    and met an amazing group of friends. The year began, obviously, with freshman
                    orientation. I was placed in team 5-L, and I had no idea how lucky I was.
                    It was on this team that I met my core group of friends, a friend group which has,
                    since then, simultaneously grown bigger and closer together (Shout out to Richard Yu, my
                    orientation leader, for fostering the social environment that sparked all of our
                    friendships). We had a team chant, team wave, and lots of team spirit. These guys,
                    and the rest of my friends who later joined us, made not only my first semester, 
                    but also my entire college experience so far, amazing.

                    The first semester was very busy, which is good because it made it go by quickly.
                    I spent a lot of time hanging out with friends, but I also joined the sailing club and 
                    spent most of my weekends on the water. I had never sailed before, so I
                    didn't really know what to expect; I didn't know if the team was competitive,
                    or if I was going to be a good fit. My worries were unfounded, though, and the people
                    in the club were super welcoming, and gave me a great introduction to one of my 
                    new favorite hobbies. The best practices were the ones where, instead of doing races or
                    drills, we just explored the bay and blasted music.

                        Whenever we weren't doing racing drills, we were sailing around the bay in 
                        "Megaboat" formation.

                <h3>First Semester: Part 2</h3>
                <p>
                    I had a crazy first couple months at RIT, and although it slowed down as the end of 
                    the semester approached, I still went on plenty of adventures with my friends. While
                    it was still warm out, we made sure to go to Durand Eastman Beach for late nights by
                    the lake. We never did end up seeing it during the day. In October,
                    my friend Will proposed we all go to a local state park, Letchworth. We packed into 
                    two cars, picked up sandwiches, and set out for the drive. This time, too, we got there
                    as the sun was going down. It seemed to be a theme for us. Nevertheless, we still
                    had fun and the views were amazing. We even had matching frog hats.

                    Having local friends - and friends with cars - was a godsend. Will, and another friend Amanda, 
                    lived in nearby towns and invited us to hang out at their houses pretty often. Having somewhere
                    to go off campus was super refreshing, and we all loved meeting their adorable pets. Of course,
                    we needed transportation, so luckily my friends Braelyn, Carey, and (again) Will had their cars.
                    We tried our best to fit everyone in when we had somewhere to go, but often some unlucky souls 
                    got stuck with the trunk. We only went short distances with trunkers, like to our friends houses,
                    the beach, or out to restaurants like China Buffet. Around the holidays, we threw mini-birthday parties 
                    for our friends, and even got invited over to Will's house for Friendsgiving. While everyone started
                    heading home for winter break, our friend Sylvie taught a bunch of us the basics of crocheting, and 
                    we made cute dinosaurs and bumble bees. It was a great way to end a great semester.

                <h3>Second Semester</h3>
                <p>
                    The second semester of my first year has gone by in the blink of an eye, seemingly way faster 
                    than the first. After winter break, it definitely took a few weeks to get back into the 
                    swing of things. The weather was bleak and cold, and we were all focused on our new classes,
                    and we went on less adventures. So when my friend Charlie told me about a concert in Syracuse,
                    I was super excited to have a reason to hang out off campus. I had my car this semester, so 
                    I drove and it was an amazing set. I went to two more concerts back home, later in February. I 
                    saw Cordae with my friends, and then Billie Eilish with my family, which were both in Boston.

                    I hung out a lot more on-campus this semester. My friends and I would meet up for ice cream
                    late at night and hang out in the lounges in the Sol or Fish dorms, or even just the 
                    Ellingson laundry room. Everyone always had projects or homework to do, so this also 
                    became group studying times. Once it got nicer out (above 30 degrees because the bar is on 
                    the floor in Rochester), we spent a lot of time outside
                    enjoying what little sun we had. There were also a lot of Spring birthdays, so we basically
                    had a little birthday party every week since we all got back from Spring break. These turned
                    into weekly movie nights, and we decided to finish the Twilight Saga by the end of the semester
                    The finale, Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2, we are actually watching during my birthday party. 
                    The end of the semester has been crazy busy, so it is nice to have down time with friends.

                        My friends and I hung out in the laundry rooms a lot during second semester. It was an 
                        easy place to get chores done, finish homework, and hang out.
