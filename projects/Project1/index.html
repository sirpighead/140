                    The tensions between Russia and Ukraine date all the
                    way to before even World War II. However, most point
                    to Russia's seizing of Crimea in 2014 as the start of 
                    the modern war in Ukraine. The aggressor country had also
                    been stoking the flames of rebellion in Ukraine's Donbas region
                    for years, leading to the pro-Russian parties in Donetsk and Luhansk
                    to declare independece in 2014. Read more about the history of
